		<h3 id="important notes"><strong>Important notes make sure you read this!</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Before reading forward you should understand how this coverflow works. As you will read installing the coverflow into your html page is straight forward and relative simple. The coverflow is using &lt;ul&gt and &lt;li&gt html elements as the base for the categories (the coverflow supports one or more categories), this way if you like you can generate the content with php or asp from a database.</p>
		<p>Each thumbnail has associated with it an action, when a thumbnail is pressed a new webpage can be opened or a lightbox with a video, image or iframe, the paths and other data for the image and video can be easely set. In case of the html content setup, the active html content from a thumbnail can be enabled to interact with any links, buttons etc that it contains.</p>
		<p>Try to keep the thumbnails count under 50, this way the performance of the coverflow will be great, if you add more it will get slower specially on mobile. The coverflow also has a separate option for the mobile case, to limit the number of the thumbnails displayed, even though the pc version contains more than this max number, because the performance may vary greatly from the pc version, especially on older mobiles phones or tablets.</p>
		<p class="red">The examples which we have used in the demo page can be found in the demo folder. There is also a start folder which contains the minimal settings for the coverflow for both the image and html contents version. Please use these files for referece to copy and paste the html and javascript code into your page.</p>
		<p>The server is character case sensitive so always use lower case characters!</p>
		
		<h3 id="setupThumbnails"><strong>Setting up the thumbnails images/html contents.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Before you start using the coverflow you need to set the thumbnailWidth and thumbnailHeight properties in the coverflow constructor, this two properties represents the thumbnail width and height. Also the thumbnailBorderSize is subtracted from these values for the final size of the image, so your final image width for example will actually be thumbnailWidth - thumbnailBorderSize.</p>
		<p>For example for 400 and 266 width and height values, and the border size 10, the width and height of the image will actually be 390 and 256, while the whole thumbnail is 400x266.</p>
		<p>The 3D setup is configured such that the center thumbnail will have the actual size, and the ones from the left and right will be scaled down. This is also the same for the 2D setup.</p>
		<p>If you find it difficult to understand this rules save your images at the same size as we did in our example.</p>
			
		<h3 id="instalationResponsiveOrFixed"><strong>How to install the coverflow with responsive / fixed width.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        <ul>
			<p class="red">Please note that in the html file which is used as reference we have used the "skin_modern_silver" skin, if you need another skin replace it by modifying the skin graphics path setting from the coverflow constructor "skinPath". All skins are located in the load folder along with the images and css files.</p>
			<li>This display type allows the coverflow to be embedded in your html page in a &lt;div&gt element. This div element (the coverflow's parent) can be located anywhere inside the page based on the page layout.</li>
        	<li>Before you start there is a start_images_responsive_or_fixed.html file in the download files in the "start" folder for the images setup and start_html_content_responsive_or_fixed.html for the html content setup. This is a start template file which you can use to copy and paste the needed code this way you can make sure you are not making any mistake while setting up the coverflow. Please note that these files contain only a few thumbnails entries, one for each lightbox media type and two cateogries for simplicity, this way it is easier to copy paste the code. If only one category is needed then delete the second &lt;ul&gt tag with the attribute data-cat. Please open these html files with a text editor like notepad or preferably notepad++.</li>
			
			<li>Make sure that you copy and paste in the same folder with your html file the java and load folder.</li>
			<li>The javascript and css files must be imported, in the head section of your html file add the code from the below image.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/script.png"></img>
			<li>Next step is to initialize the coverflow with javascript, in the head section add code from the below image. Please note that all parameters are described in the <a href="#config">constructor parameters</a> section</li>
			<img src="assets/images/constructor.png"></img>
			<li>You need a &lt;div&gt element into which the coverflow will be added as a child. This &lt;div&gt element (the coverflow's parent) can be located anywhere inside the page based on the page layout, so create a &lt;div&gt and set an id for it, the id is important because it is passed in the coverflow constructor, make sure it is unique. The div width and height and background color are set in the constructor, (example in the image below)</li>
			<img src="assets/images/div.png"></img>
			<li>There are three required and important parameters in the constructor (coverflowWidth, coverflowHeight, autoscale and skinPath), the width and height represents the maximum width and height of the parent &lt;div&gt and coverflow, so for example if you need the coverflow at a width of 940px and height of 538px just set that in the constructor (example in the image below).</li>
			<img src="assets/images/required.png"></img>
			<li>The autoscale is useful only if the layout is responsive or fluidwidth, this means that if you have a responsive layout and the layout width is less then the coverflow width specified in the constructor and you want to keep a correct ratio then set autoscale to yes otherwise set it to no, if autoscale is set to yes the parent &lt;div&gt and coverflow width and height will change based on the layout width this way a correct ratio is kept, if you don't want the height to change then set autoscale to no and only the coverflow width will be modified.</li>
			<li>The skinPath is the path to the folder that contains all the skin graphics image files, for example "load/skin_modern_silver".</li>
			<li>Next step is to add the in the body element an &lt;div&gt element which represents the coverflow datalist, this  &lt;div&gt element must have an unique id which is passed in the constructor. Inside this &lt;div&gt element the coverflow categories are constructed. This is best illustrated in the below image. To add categories just copy and paste  an  &lt;ul&gt element with an attribute <span class="boldLi">data-cat</span> (please note that in the below image the html code is minimized, to view the entire html code observe the start_images_responsive_or_fixed.html). Make sure you read the <a href="#datalist">coverflow datalist</a> section to understand how to add more cateogries, thumbnails and configure the coverflow datalist.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/data.png"></img>
			<li>These are all the steps needed to setup the coverflow, again all this code is located in the "start" folder in the four html files so you can copy and paste the code easily without errors. Please make sure to read the <a href="#config">constructor parameters</a> section to understand all the coverflow properties.</li>
         </ul>   
		 
		 <h3 id="instalationFluidWidth"><strong>How to install the coverflow with fluid width.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		 <p>This display type allows the coverflow to be embedded in your html page and it will always fill the browser width. This div element (the coverflow's parent) can be located anywhere inside the page based on the page layout. Please follow the same rules as in the <a href="#instalationResponsiveOrFixed">How to install the coverflow with responsive / fixed width</a>. The only difference is that in the constructor the display type parameter must be set to fluidwidth like this:<span class="boldLi">displayType:"fluidwidth"</span>. Please note that there is a html file named start_images_fluid_width.html for the images setup or start_html_content_fluid_width.html for the html content setup as reference from which the html code can be copied and pasted into your own html page.</p>
		          
		<h3 id="config"><strong> Constructor parameters.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

Inside the &lt;ul&gt element with the attribute <span class="boldLi">data-cat</span> thumbnails with images or html content can be added (please read  <a href="#datalist">Adding thumbnails and media</a>). To remove the category just delete the &lt;ul&gt element with an attribute <span class="boldLi">data-cat</span> which you don't need. Please note that if the coverflow has only one category the combobox will be disabled/not visible. This is better illustrated in the below image, please note that we minified the html code, to view it maximized open any of the html files from the "start" folder provided in the download files.</p>

        <h3 id="datalist"><strong>Adding thumbnails, html contents and media.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This section describes how to add a thumbnail and how to configure it so that it display videos, images, iframes, html contents or open links. Make sure you have opened any of the html files from the "start" folder provided, in a text editor for reference. First you need to know that each thumbnail is associated with an image, video, iframe, link, html content or can be set to have no action on click. Please note that the &lt;li&gt with the attribute <span class="boldLi">data-info</span> which represents the lightbox description is optional, also the &lt;li&gt with the attribute <span class="boldLi">data-thumbnail-text</span> which represents the thumbnail description is optional if the <span class="boldLi">showText</span> is set to "no". To add more thumbnails just copy paste a &lt;li&gt element like in the examples below in the category of your choosing.</p>
		
		<p><b>Setting no click action:</b></p>
		<p>To set no action at the thumbnail click you just have to set <span class="boldLi">data-type</span> to "none", you can add the code from the below image into the datalist &lt;ul&gt just like the image below. The second &lt;li&gt element represents the thumbnails path, the third &lt;li&gt element represents the thumbnail description and the forth &lt;li&gt element represents the lightbox description. The three extra text settings are used separately for each thumb to set the thumbnail text description and title. The first one text-title-offset is used to show more or less of the text in case of a title on double lines for example, or it can even be 0 if you don't want the title to be displayed at all except on mouse hover. The next two settings text-offset-top and text-offset-bottom are used to position the text after it is fully displayed at mouse hover such that it can be centralised better.</p>

		<p><b>Adding a link to open when a thumbnail is pressed:</b></p>
		<p>To add a link to a thumbnail add the code from the below image into the datalist &lt;ul&gt just like the image below.

The three extra text settings are used separately for each thumb to set the thumbnail text description and title.

		<img src="assets/images/link.png"></img>
		
		<p><b>Adding a html content:</b></p>
		<p>The only difference to the image thumbnail is that the second &lt;li&gt element contains the html content directly, where the image had the thumbnail path. Also you must have this setting  <span class="boldLi">showThumbnailsHtmlContent</span> set to "yes". Instead the data-thumbnail-path setting, the one for html content will have a data-html-content setting, and the &lt;li&gt itself will contain any html content you want, you can add divs, tables, links, texts, buttons etc all of them modifiable with CSS. The lightbox features for opening a link, or showing a video or iframe remain the same. The next example will be for a link.</p>
		To add a html content add the code from the below image into the datalist &lt;ul&gt just like the image below. The first &lt;li&gt element represents the link data as you can see you can add the url to open when the thumbnail is pressed and the url target, the second &lt;li&gt element represents the div that contains any html content you want also with CSS, the third &lt;li&gt element represents the thumbnail description and the forth &lt;li&gt element represents the lightbox description.The three extra text settings are used separately for each thumb to set the thumbnail text description and title. The first one text-title-offset is used to show more or less of the text in case of a title on double lines for example, or it can even be 0 if you don't want the title to be displayed at all except on mouse hover. The next two settings text-offset-top and text-offset-bottom are used to position the text after it is fully displayed at mouse hover such that it can be centralised better.</p>
		<img src="assets/images/html.png"></img>
		
		<p>In the case that you set the <span class="boldLi">data-type</span> to "none", then it will enable the thumbnails html content to be active such that you can click on the links or buttons etc. Also in this case you can also remove the &lt;li&gt element for the text leaving just the html content visible, just like in the image below:</p>
