If you have any questions about the this plugin usage or installation you can send me a message asking for support.

But before send the me message, please follow the recommendations below. This will help me to help you faster:

- Send the first email through CodeCanyon website*. Login at codecanyon http://codecanyon.net/ with the account used to bought the wowbook's license. IMPORTANT: use the account that bought the wowbook's license. Go to the item support page http://codecanyon.net/item/wowbook-a-flipbook-jquery-plugin/1791563/support . Send the message

- Write in english, please. If english is a problem i suggest you to use google translator. I use google translator to translate the text from my language to english, then i translate it back to my language. If the final result is similar to the original, i send the translation. If not, i try to change the words and make simpler statements until I get a satisfactory result. I do this and i've been able to communicate in english for years, it works really well for me.

- Found a bug? I'm sorry for that. In order to fix the bug i need be able to reproduce it.
	- Send me which browser and OS are you using.
	- Check if the problem happens on the wowbook live preview or the examples bundled with the plugin.
	- If the bug only happen on your project put it online or send me the project files zipped.
	- It helps a lot(meaning: you will get your answer faster) if you create a minimal version of project that shows the bug. Sometimes i spend a lot of time navigating through javascript and css on the webpage that are unrelated to the bug. Since it's your webpage you know right away what can be discarded or not.
	- Make a list of steps to reproduce the bug.

Except for the first item on the list, these are recommendations. Not following them does not mean you will not get help, but it can reduce dramatically the time needed to resolve your problem.



*When you send a message through CodeCanyon, i receive the email with a link generated by Codecanyon's system. This link sends me to page where i can confirm that the message comes from a account that bought the plugin.

I'm aware this is a inconvenience. But it takes a good amount of my time to write these answers in english. If i don't do this minimum verification, i will spend my time giving support for people who did not bought the plugin, while legitimate buyers (like yourself) will be keep waiting for support. Hope you can understand that.
